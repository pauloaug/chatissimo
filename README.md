Distributed chat based on DDS

Chatissimo is a chat web app that uses RTI DDS Connext to send text messages between participants.
The system architecture is based on a java server backend accessing the RTI java API, and an HTML frontend.
They talk to each other using the WebSocket protocol.
It is still a prototype, but has been already succesfully tested with a few participants.
